# SillyBayesianStatistics
A place for my silly office statistics!

## Paperball
This folder is the place for my paper ball experiment where I threw paperballs into the garbage can from my desk for 2 years. A notebook in there goes through the analysis of my dubious performance.

## Dart experiment
The dart experiment is open to anyone that can access the building, has a umn email and can shoot a dart gun. There are some basic rules for the experiment
1) you may only shoot once a day and record you score with the time and date in this spread sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sl-eV6wPPgz0wzxQ-nmaDdVh_KjiAMMZemnZl5Y80UM/edit?usp=sharing
2) You must shoot from out side the office
3) If the dart gun malfunctions you may try again
4) If the dart does not stick to the wall you score 0
5) If your dart lands on a line choose the lower score option

If you have any other questions please open an issue or speak to me
